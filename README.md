# 🏥 OroEYE: The Future of Oral Analysis

**STOP. SCROLLING.**
You just found the coolest, most robust, and straight-up **banger** of a medical AI tool you'll see today.

This isn't just some "school project." This is **OroEYE**.
We built this beast to tackle oral cancer detection head-on, blending state-of-the-art **Deep Learning** with a UI that actually looks like it belongs in 2026. No boring medical interfaces here. We believe saving lives should look **good**.

## 🚀 Why This Exists (The "Real Talk")

Oral cancer is scary. Identifying it shouldn't be confusing.
Most medical tools look like they were built for Windows 95. We said **"NO."**

We wanted something that feels premium, works instantly, and gives you answers without the headache.
We used **InceptionResNetV2** (yeah, the heavy hitter) to act as the brain, and we wrapped it in a customized, dark-mode-first, glassmorphism-dripping interface that makes analysis feel like magic.

## 🔥 Features That Slap

*   **Cyberpunk-Grade Analysis:** Upload an image, and our AI tears through it to find anomalies.
*   **Smart Validation (No Junk Allowed):** Try uploading a selfie? A picture of your cat? The system **KNOWS**. It checks for flesh tones, rejects random nonsense, and ensures only valid medical images get analyzed.
*   **Heatmap Vision (Grad-CAM):** We don't just tell you "Cancer Detected." We show you **EXACTLY WHERE** the AI is looking. It's like X-Ray vision for your browser.
*   **Floating Navbar & HUD Footer:** The UI floats. It glows. It responds. It's pure eye candy.
*   **Instant Feedback:** No waiting around. Boom. Results. Done.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack (Built Different)

We didn't just throw this together. We forged it.

*   **Backend:** Python & Flask (Robust. Reliable. Fast.)
*   **The Brain:** TensorFlow & Keras (The muscle behind the magic)
*   **Vision:** OpenCV (For that smart image validation)
*   **Frontend:** Vanilla JS & CSS (No bloated frameworks. Just pure, optimized speed.)

## ⚡ How to Run This Beast

Want to see it in action? Let's get it running on your machine.
(Don't worry, it's easy.)

### 1. Steal (Clone) The Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourRepo/OroEYE.git
cd OroEYE
```

### 2. Prepare the Environment
Don't mess up your global python. Be smart. Use a virtual env.
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux users (The cool kids)
# venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows users (We still love you)
```

### 3. Feed the Beast (Dependencies)
Install the magic sauce.
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Ignite the Engine
Start only the backend. The frontend is served right from there because we optimized it like crazy.
```bash
python app.py
```

### 5. Witness Greatness
Open your browser and hit:
👉 `http://127.0.0.1:5001`

## ⚠️ Notes for the Curious

*   **"Why does it say Non-Cancerous?"** -> If you don't have the massive AI model file (`best_model.h5`), the system runs in **Simulation Mode**. It defaults to "Non-Cancerous" so you don't panic during a demo. Smart, right?
*   **Image Validation:** If your image gets rejected, it's because our validation logic is doing its job. It wants clear, oral cavity photos. No blurry messes.

## 🤝 Credits

**Built with Sweat, Tears, and Caffeine.**
This wasn't generated by some AI. This was coded by humans who care about pixels, performance, and impact.

**OroEYE.** Because better tech means better health.
Now go run it. 🚀
